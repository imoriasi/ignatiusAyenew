                JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. 
                It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser),
                JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.

                JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date,
                 and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, 
                 and statements. 
                 Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
            </p><br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects 
                    to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, 
                    form input, and page navigation.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to 
                    running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application,
                     or perform file manipulations on a server.
                </li>
            </ul><br>
